SUMMARY
Organs are composed of diverse cell types that change across space and time during development. During lung morphogenesis, patterning of cell identities occurs along a proximal to distal axis. To interrogate this patterning across the entire axis of the human lung, we integrated single-nucleus sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, creating a spatially resolved cell atlas during the late pseudoglandular stage. This atlas reveals changes in cell composition and heterogeneity along the proximal-distal axis in the immune, mesenchymal and epithelial compartments, and identifies a human- and fetal-specific TP63+ basal cell state distinguished by expression of LGR5 and LGR6. Analysis of the fetal basal cell niche and functional experiments in primary organoid models suggest a tonic level of WNT pathway activity in LGR5+ basal cells that enhances self-renewal and is potentiated by R-SPONDIN derived from mesenchymal populations enriched in the proximal lung. These data suggest that the WNT pathway plays a previously unappreciated but critical role in airway stem cell maintenance during human lung development. Surprisingly, while basal cells are mostly devoid of LGR5 in the adult trachea, adult basal cells are responsive to R-SPONDIN in vitro, reacquiring a fetal-like state. Our results reveal unique positional niches supporting the epithelium, and highlight the role of WNT signaling for self-renewal of basal cells during development, findings which may have implications for lung regeneration throughout the human lifespan.
